"""
Boolean values in Python are `True` and `False`, which are immutable and case-sensitive.
They are often used to represent the truth value of expressions.
"""
#example
print(True > False)
print(True < False)
"""
Explanation:
    - `True` is internally represented as `1` and `False` as `0`.
    - Therefore, `True > False` evaluates to `1 > 0`, which is `True`.
    - Similarly, `True < False` evaluates to `1 < 0`, which is `False`.
