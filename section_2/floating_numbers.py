#a floating number is a number that has a decimal point in it, or is in scientific notation
# a floating number can be positive or negative, and can also be in scientific notation
# a floating number can also be in scientific notation, which is a way of writing very large or very small numbers using powers of 10
# scientific notation is written as a number followed by "e" or "E" and then the exponent (e.g., 1.23e10)
# for example, 1.23e10 is equal to 1.23 * 10^10, which is 12300000000
# and 1.23e-10 is equal to 1.23 * 10^-10, which is 0.000000000123

print(123.456) # this is a floating number, it has a decimal point in it
print(123.456e10) # this is a floating number in scientific notation, it is equal to 123.456 * 10^10, which is 1234560000000
print(123.456e-10) # this is a floating number in scientific notation, it is equal to 123.456 * 10^-10, which is 0.0000000123456
print(-123.123) # this is a negative floating number, it has a decimal point in it
